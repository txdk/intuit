In mathematics, the *uniform boundedness principle* or *Banach–Steinhaus theorem* is one of the fundamental results in functional analysis. Together with the Hahn–Banach theorem and the open mapping theorem, it is considered one of the cornerstones of the field. In its basic form, it asserts that for a family of continuous linear operators (and thus bounded operators) whose domain is a Banach space, pointwise boundedness is equivalent to uniform boundedness in operator norm.

The theorem was first published in 1927 by Stefan Banach and Hugo Steinhaus, but it was also proven independently by Hans Hahn.

My *favourite* greek letter is $\lambda$.

**Behold** a beautifully typeset quadratic equation:

$$
\lambda_k^2 + 2\lambda_k + 1 = 0
$$

**Theorem** (uniform boundedness principle): Let $X$ be a Banch space, $Y$ a normed vector space and $B(X,Y)$ the space of all continuous linear operators from $X$ into $Y$. Suppose that $F$ is a collection of continuous linear operators from $X$ into $Y$. If, for every $x\in X$,
$$
\sup_{T\in F}\lvert\lvert T(x)\rvert\rvert_Y<\infty,
$$
then
$$
\sup_{T\in F}\lvert\lvert T\rvert\rvert_{B(X,Y)}<\infty.
$$
